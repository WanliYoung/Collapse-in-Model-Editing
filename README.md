# Collapse-in-Model-Editing
This repository hosts the code and data for the paper [🦋🌪️ The Butterfly Effect of Model Editing: Few Edits Can Trigger Large Language Models Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09656). Currently, we provide the *ME-PPL* dataset, with additional datasets (*HardCF* and *HardEdit*) and code scheduled for future release.
